# I.N.F.E.R.N.O.S.

### Interactive Neural Framework for Efficient Realtime Network Operations on Streams

ðŸ”¥ Welcome to Infernos, where data comes to life in real-time! ðŸ”¥

## Overview

Harness the power of **I.N.F.E.R.N.O.S.** to transform audio, video, and
text streams with state-of-the-art inference in an instant. Embrace a
blazing-fast future, free from lag.

## News

Work is underway to scale TTS performance 50x. Stay tuned.

I am going to present at FOSDEM 2024 (RTC track). See you all there!

## Features

-   **Interactive:** Infernos isn't just another tool; it's an
    experience. Speak in one voice and marvel as it's automatically
    translated into a completely different tone or even language, and
    then seamlessly transmitted in real-time during phone or web
    meetings.

-   **Neural Power:** With deep learning at its core, Infernos is
    optimized for top-notch performance.

-   **Multimodal Support:** Whether it's audio, video, or text, Infernos
    handles them with elegance.

-   **Efficiency:** Designed for low-latency, high-throughput
    operations.

-   **Realtime:** Don't wait. Experience the magic as it unfolds.

## Quick Start

1.  Clone the repository:

&nbsp;

    git clone https://github.com/sippy/Infernos.git

2.  Navigate to the project directory and install dependencies:

&nbsp;

    cd Infernos && pip install -r requirements.txt

3.  Light the fire:

&nbsp;

    python Infernos.py -f

4.  Use SIP device or software such as Linphone to place a SIP
    call to `sip:anything@localhost:5060`. Replace `localhost`
    with a local IP of machine running Infernos if testing over
    LAN.
